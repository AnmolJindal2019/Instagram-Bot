# Instagram-Bot
---
Made an Instagram bot which simulates actions of a user using Selenium and Python.

Currently these actions can be performed using the bot:
  1. Logging into the profile (Code automatically handles the popups that appear during login)
  2. search for a profile in search menu
  3. open a profile
  4. follow/unfollow a profile
  5. like/dislike posts of a user
  6. Get the number of followers of a user
  7. view the story(if present) of a user
  8. Extract List of followers of a user

Wait and sleep has been used at appropriate places, so that the actual functioning is visible and and instragram also does not find the activity to be suspicious.
